# K-means Clustering Part One

In this project I used an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to gain unbiased insights about overlooked developing countries. 

The analysis has been conducted as the final project for the Python for Data Science course offered by the UC San Diego on the edx e-learning platform.
It is my intention to extra-curricularly further this investigation in a subsequent part of this project, with the proceedings hinted to in the "Conclusion" section of the presentation.
As I am already undergoing it, this is the reason why the cluster composition in the notebook is different from the one in the presentation (which is the same that I submitted for grading). 

The Jupiter Notebook file contains the proceedings, the Powerpoint file the presentation.

required package(s):

numpy / pandas / skleanr
