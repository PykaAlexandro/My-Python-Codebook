# Exploratory Data Analysis with Python

In this project I use basic statistical inquiries and plotting to investigate the similarities and differences in development trends by Italy and Brazil with the mean of an economic indicators dataset compiled by the World Bank and available on Kaggle.

The analysis has been conducted as a mid-term project for the Python for Data Science course offered by the UC San Diego on the edx e-learning platform.

The Jupiter Notebook file contains the proceedings, the Powerpoint file the presentation.

required package(s):
